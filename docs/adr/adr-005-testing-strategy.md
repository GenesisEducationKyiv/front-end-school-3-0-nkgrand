# ADR-005: Testing Strategy

## Date

2025-05-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Effective testing is crucial for maintaining application quality and enabling confident refactoring. We needed a testing strategy that would:
- Ensure code reliability
- Support rapid development
- Catch bugs early
- Enable safe refactoring
- Support team collaboration

Key testing requirements:
- Unit testing for business logic
- Component testing for UI
- End-to-end testing capability
- Easy test writing and maintenance
- Fast test execution
- Clear test reports

## Decision

We implemented a comprehensive testing strategy using the following tools and approaches:

1. Testing Stack:
   - Jest + ts-jest for unit and integration tests
   - React Testing Library for component tests
   - data-testid attributes for reliable element selection
   - Preparation for future e2e testing (Playwright/Cypress)

2. Test Organization:
   ```
   src/
   ├── __tests__/                    # Test files
   │   ├── unit/                     # Unit tests
   │   ├── integration/              # Integration tests
   │   └── components/               # Component tests
   ├── components/
   │   └── ComponentName/
   │       ├── ComponentName.tsx
   │       └── ComponentName.test.tsx # Co-located tests
   ```

3. Testing Patterns:
   - Component tests focus on user interactions and rendering
   - Store tests verify state management logic
   - Integration tests check component-store interaction
   - Use of data-testid for reliable selections
   - Consistent test naming and structure

## Testing Levels

1. Unit Tests:
   - Individual functions and utilities
   - Store actions and computations
   - Helper functions
   - Type guards and validators

2. Component Tests:
   - UI component rendering
   - User interactions
   - State changes
   - Event handlers

3. Integration Tests:
   - Store and component integration
   - API integration
   - Complex user flows

4. Future E2E Tests:
   - Critical user paths
   - Full application flows
   - Real browser testing

## Alternatives Considered

### Jest + Enzyme

Pros:
- Mature ecosystem
- Detailed component testing
- Rich API

Cons:
- More complex setup
- Moving away from React's direction
- More brittle tests

### Vitest

Pros:
- Fast execution
- Native ESM support
- Vite integration

Cons:
- Newer tool
- Smaller ecosystem
- Less documentation

## Consequences

### Positive

1. Quality Benefits:
   - Early bug detection
   - Confident refactoring
   - Clear test coverage
   - Reliable test results

2. Development Benefits:
   - Fast feedback cycle
   - Easy test writing
   - Good developer experience
   - Clear testing patterns

3. Maintenance Benefits:
   - Stable test suite
   - Easy to update tests
   - Good test organization
   - Clear failure reports

### Negative

1. Development Overhead:
   - Need to maintain test code
   - Additional setup time
   - Learning curve for testing
   - Test maintenance effort

2. Technical Considerations:
   - Test runtime overhead
   - CI/CD integration needed
   - Mock management
   - Test data maintenance

## Notes

- Use data-testid for element selection
- Avoid implementation details in tests
- Focus on user behavior
- Keep tests simple and focused
