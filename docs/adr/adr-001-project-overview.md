## Date

## Status

Accepted

## Context

This document describes the initial context and requirements for the Audio Tracks Management SPA project. The project started from a blank template (vite + react-ts) and needed to establish a foundation that would support both immediate needs and future growth.

## Initial Requirements

The project needed to support the following core functionalities:

1. Track Management:
   - Display a list of tracks with search capabilities
   - Implement filtering functionality
   - Support pagination for large datasets
   - Enable CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

2. Audio Features:
   - Support audio file uploads
   - Enable audio file removal
   - Provide audio playback functionality

3. User Experience:
   - Implement a user-friendly interface
   - Ensure responsive design
   - Provide immediate feedback for user actions

4. Technical Requirements:
   - Support end-to-end testing
   - Ensure code maintainability
   - Enable easy onboarding for new developers
   - Support future scalability

## Decision

Based on these requirements, we decided to:

1. Use a modern JavaScript framework ecosystem
2. Implement a component-based architecture
3. Follow TypeScript best practices for type safety
4. Establish a clear project structure
5. Set up a comprehensive testing strategy

The specific technical decisions regarding state management, UI framework, testing tools, and project structure are detailed in separate ADR documents:

- ADR-002: State Management with MobX
- ADR-003: UI Framework Selection (Ant Design)
- ADR-004: Project Structure
- ADR-005: Testing Strategy

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear separation of concerns in documentation
- Easy to reference specific architectural decisions
- Better onboarding documentation
- Foundation for future architectural decisions

### Negative

- Need to maintain multiple ADR documents
- Requires cross-referencing between documents
- Initial setup requires more documentation effort
