# ADR-006: Migration from Axios to Ky HTTP Client

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Currently, the project uses Axios as its HTTP client library. While Axios has served us well, 
recent security audits and performance analysis suggest that moving to a more modern, lighter-weight 
solution could benefit the project. Ky, built on top of the Fetch API, presents a compelling alternative 
with better TypeScript support and a smaller footprint.

## Current State
- HTTP Client: Axios v1.8.4
- Bundle Size: ~32KB
- Dependencies: Multiple
- TypeScript Support: Partial
- Security Status: Currently secure, but larger attack surface due to size and dependencies

## Decision
Propose migrating from Axios to Ky as our HTTP client library.

### Rationale
1. **Security Benefits**:
   - Smaller bundle size (~13KB) = reduced attack surface
   - Fewer dependencies = fewer potential vulnerabilities
   - Built on modern Fetch API = leverages browser security

2. **Technical Benefits**:
   - Native TypeScript support
   - Modern Promise-based API
   - Smaller bundle size
   - Better performance

3. **Maintenance Benefits**:
   - Simpler codebase
   - Fewer dependencies to maintain
   - Better type safety

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Preparation (Week 1)
1. Install Ky package
2. Create HTTP client abstraction layer
3. Document current Axios usage patterns

### Phase 2: Migration (Weeks 2-3)
1. Create new API client using Ky
2. Implement feature parity with current Axios usage
3. Write tests for new implementation
4. Create utility functions for common use cases

### Phase 3: Testing (Week 4)
1. Unit tests for new client
2. Integration tests
3. Performance testing
4. Security testing

### Phase 4: Rollout (Week 5)
1. Gradual replacement in non-critical features
2. Monitor for issues
3. Full replacement
4. Remove Axios

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risks:
1. **Breaking Changes**:
   - Different API structure
   - Different handling of responses
   - Different error handling

2. **Browser Support**:
   - Fetch API compatibility
   - Older browser support

3. **Integration Issues**:
   - Third-party services
   - File uploads
   - Progress tracking

### Mitigation:
1. **Breaking Changes**:
   - Create abstraction layer
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Gradual rollout

2. **Browser Support**:
   - Add polyfills where needed
   - Document minimum requirements

3. **Integration**:
   - Test all third-party integrations
   - Create specific adapters if needed

## Success Metrics
1. Zero security vulnerabilities
2. Reduced bundle size
3. Improved TypeScript type coverage
4. No regression in functionality
5. Successful test coverage

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Improved security profile
- Smaller bundle size
- Better TypeScript support
- Modern API design
- Fewer dependencies

### Negative:
- Development time required for migration
- Potential learning curve for team
- Need to update documentation
- Temporary code complexity during migration
