# ADR-003: UI Framework Selection (Ant Design)

## Date

2025-05-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The application requires a comprehensive UI component library that can support:
- Complex data tables with sorting and filtering
- Modal dialogs and forms
- Search inputs and filters
- Loading states and notifications
- Icons and basic UI elements
- Responsive design patterns

Key requirements for the UI framework:
- Rich set of pre-built components
- Good TypeScript support
- Customization capabilities
- Active maintenance and community
- Performance optimization options
- Comprehensive documentation

## Decision

We chose **Ant Design v5.24.7** as our UI framework. Implementation aspects include:

1. Core Components Used:
   - Table (for tracks listing)
   - Modal (for create/edit forms)
   - Form (for data input)
   - Input (for search and filtering)
   - Button (for actions)
   - Notification (for feedback)
   - Space and Layout components (for structure)

2. Theme Configuration:
   - Global theme customization through ConfigProvider
   - Component-level style overrides when needed
   - Custom theme tokens for consistency

3. Component Usage Pattern:
   - Direct import of needed components
   - Consistent props usage across the application
   - TypeScript integration for prop validation

## Alternatives Considered

### Material-UI (MUI)

Pros:
- Modern and popular
- Extensive component library
- Strong theming system
- Good documentation

Cons:
- More complex customization
- Heavier bundle size
- Less suitable for admin interfaces
- More opinionated styling approach

### Chakra UI

Pros:
- Modern and accessible
- Good developer experience
- Flexible styling system
- Light bundle size

Cons:
- Less comprehensive component set
- Fewer specialized components
- Smaller community
- Less mature data grid solutions

## Consequences

### Positive

1. Development Benefits:
   - Rapid UI development
   - Consistent component patterns
   - Rich set of pre-built components
   - Strong TypeScript integration

2. User Experience Benefits:
   - Professional look and feel
   - Consistent behavior patterns
   - Responsive by default
   - Accessible components

3. Maintenance Benefits:
   - Active community support
   - Regular updates and bug fixes
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Easy to find solutions

### Negative

1. Technical Considerations:
   - Large bundle size
   - Some components are overly complex
   - Default styling can be limiting
   - Performance impact with large tables

2. Development Limitations:
   - Need to follow Ant Design patterns
   - Some customizations require extra work
   - Learning curve for complex components
   - Version updates may require adjustments

## Notes

- We use the latest v5 version for modern features
- Bundle optimization might be needed
- Consider code splitting for large components
- Custom components should follow Ant Design patterns
