# ADR-004: Project Structure

## Date

2025-05-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

A clear and scalable project structure is crucial for:
- Maintaining code organization as the project grows
- Enabling efficient development workflows
- Supporting team collaboration
- Facilitating code reuse
- Making the codebase easy to navigate

We needed a structure that would:
- Clearly separate concerns
- Support modular development
- Enable easy testing
- Scale with the application
- Be intuitive for new developers

## Decision

We implemented a feature-based directory structure with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
├── api/              # API layer
│   └── trackApi.ts   # Track-related API calls
├── assets/           # Static assets
│   └── icons/        # SVG icons
├── components/       # Shared UI components
│   ├── Header/
│   └── common/
├── pages/           # Main application views
│   ├── Tracks/
│   │   ├── Tracks.tsx
│   │   ├── TracksTable.tsx
│   │   └── __components/
│   ├── Albums/
│   └── Artists/
├── context/         # React contexts
│   └── TrackStoreContext.ts
├── provider/        # Context providers
│   └── TrackStoreProvider.tsx
├── stores/          # MobX stores
│   └── TrackStore.ts
├── types/           # TypeScript types
│   └── trackTypes.ts
├── utils/           # Utility functions
│   └── formatters.ts
├── App.tsx          # Root component
└── main.tsx        # Entry point
```

Key organizational principles:

1. Feature-based Organization:
   - Each major feature has its own directory
   - Components are co-located with their feature
   - Shared code is lifted to common directories

2. Clear Dependencies:
   - Unidirectional data flow
   - Clear import/export patterns
   - Minimal circular dependencies

3. Component Structure:
   ```typescript
   /ComponentName
     ├── index.ts
     ├── ComponentName.tsx
     ├── ComponentName.test.tsx
     └── ComponentName.styles.ts
   ```

## Alternatives Considered

### Flat Structure

Pros:
- Simpler to start with
- Less initial overhead
- Easier file lookup

Cons:
- Doesn't scale well
- Hard to maintain as project grows
- Poor separation of concerns

### Domain-Driven Structure

Pros:
- Better for large applications
- Clear business domain separation
- Good for microservices

Cons:
- Overhead for small projects
- More complex setup
- Requires team buy-in

## Consequences

### Positive

1. Development Benefits:
   - Clear file organization
   - Easy to find components
   - Natural scaling path
   - Good separation of concerns

2. Team Benefits:
   - Clear ownership
   - Easy onboarding
   - Consistent patterns
   - Reduced conflicts

3. Maintenance Benefits:
   - Easy to add features
   - Simple refactoring
   - Clear dependencies
   - Good test organization

### Negative

1. Overhead:
   - More initial setup
   - More directories to manage
   - Need to maintain structure

2. Complexity:
   - Deeper file nesting
   - More import paths
   - Need for index files

## Notes

- Use index.ts files for clean exports
- Keep components close to their usage
- Lift shared code when needed
- Document structure changes
